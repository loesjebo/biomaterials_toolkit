# Biomaterials Teaching Toolkit

> Materials can help to expose the cracks of our ailing systems; because they have the power to solidify new norms; because they can make more preferable futures tangible.

– Liz Corbin, materials researcher & designer

What you have in your hands is a teaching toolkit for critical materials research in higher design and arts education. It comes out of a 2-year project at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, where we – a group of design educators and/or researchers –  developed ways to invite bachelor students to explore making practices that center ecosystems rather than human systems. With this toolkit, we share our tried and tested activities, which take bio-based design materials and their unique properties as a point of departure, and offer hands-on activities to critically engage in sustainable material research. 

This toolkit will provide you ways to see materials anew, by learning more about them, exploring alternatives, or altogether defamiliarising ourselves from what we think materials can and should do. 


## A critical, transdisciplinary approach to (material) making

The activities described in these cards invite learners to draw together insights from material science, industrial manufacturing, microbiology, material culture, design and arts as well as ancient crafts practices. Creating “new” natural materials here refers less to inventing novelty materials or being a contemporary nano-alchemist or genetic engineer. It refers to a new way of looking at materials that share a common characteristic: they are created from feedstocks that were once alive and regenerative. And more radically: some are biomanufactured by leveraging living systems without killing those living systems at all, instead enveloping them into making processes without depleting or destroying them. This toolkit helps you explore natural materials and growth processes in a hands-on way, while asking questions that unsettle what everyday human-made objects look and feel like, and the creative strategies, manufacturing processes and social and ecological systems involved in creating them.

## How to use this toolkit

From cooking bioplastics in your kitchen, to hands-on collaborations with fungi: these activities will help you get acquainted and collaborate with natural substances and living organisms to inspire regenerative and sustainable design and arts projects. The prompts provided in this toolkit can be combined to create longer programs in higher education, based on interest, audience, resources and time available.

### Themes and categories

The cards are structured around four themes that each contribute to understanding and making sustainable materials and sustainable modes of production. Depending on your aim and audience you can combine cards from the categories Materiology, Bio-based Materials, DIY Microbiology and Critical Making. Each category contains a mix of reflective, practical, creative and more conceptual activities. We recommend teachers explore each activity with peers first to get an understanding of the workflow, needs, and potential risks to be aware of. 

The set is not exhaustive and certainly leaves room for many more and different activities. But it aspires to give educators (as well as students, even researchers) practical starting points to imagine material futures without petrol-based plastics and toxic materials.

## Recommended suppliers (NL)

Finding the things you need can be a chore, here’s our list of recommended suppliers in the Netherlands: 

* Eurofysica – lab supplies for schools
* Labshop – lab supplies, chemical compounds, cellulose
* De Hekserij – chemical compounds, e.g., calcium chloride
* Unique Products – carrageenan and alginate (via Friedas.nl)
